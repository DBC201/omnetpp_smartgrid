This is a fork of OMNeT++ 6.0.3. The original repo along with the source code can be found at: https://github.com/omnetpp/omnetpp/tree/omnetpp-6.0.3

The purpose of this fork is to help simulating smart grid communications for research purposes.

This has been built and tested for Linux OS's with x86_64 architecture. The release version with the ide pre built similar to the releases provided in OMNeT++ is available in the release section of this repository. It can also be downloaded by clicking [here](https://github.com/DBC201/omnetpp_smartgrid/releases/download/52ecc32/omnetpp_smartgrid-linux-x86_64.tgz).

Following changes were made to the original code:
- IDE build was configured for development purposes: [f571189](https://github.com/DBC201/omnetpp_smartgrid/commit/f571189a4858f144fb0be291642409c25cc71535), [c34a543](https://github.com/DBC201/omnetpp_smartgrid/commit/c34a543340d44ebda450a58d2bb1f037daeb396d)
- A hardcoded link to [inet_smartgrid](https://github.com/DBC201/inet_smartgrid) was added so that it can be set up with ease: [e8055b0](https://github.com/DBC201/omnetpp_smartgrid/commit/e8055b00196072b4305e4da9546c82002fbdf604)
- Vector buffer and vector memory limit was increased to support low delay SV packet traffic defined by IEC61850: [38eb53c](https://github.com/DBC201/omnetpp_smartgrid/commit/38eb53cece2c06ec9ca67f20494327962ceada29)

OMNeT++
~~~~~~~

OMNeT++ is a public-source, component-based, modular and open-architecture
simulation environment with strong GUI support and an embeddable simulation
kernel. Its primary application area is the simulation of communication
networks, but it has been successfully used in other areas like the simulation
of IT systems, queueing networks, hardware architectures and business processes
as well.

If you installed and successfully compiled the source distribution, the omnetpp
directory on your system should contain the following subdirectories.
(If you installed a precompiled distribution, some of the directories may be missing,
or there might be additional directories, e.g. containing software bundled with OMNeT++.)

The simulation system itself:

  omnetpp/         OMNeT++ root directory

The example simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example simulations are designed to demonstrate many of the features of
OMNeT++. We recommend that you try tictoc first, which also has an
accompanying tutorial under doc/.
